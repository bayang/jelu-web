* tags are commonly used to list genres of books but in Jelu tags are also a central piece of organization and communication with others
* in your dashboard you can choose a list of tags to be dislayed or bookmarked on your home page, these are called "shelves"
* tags are shared at the instance level, meaning you can agree with another user to use some tags to create a shared book list
  * for example your instance is used for your home, you and the other prople living in your house can use tags to create the 'living-room' collection, or the 'bedroom' collection
  * you can also make a common "to-read" list to share with somebody else
* tags can also denote years or events (like "summer-2022" for example)
* see [this issue](https://github.com/bayang/jelu/issues/62) for a discussion about what is possible
