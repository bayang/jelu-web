* The author detail page allows you to automatically fetch an author's metadata from wikipedia or manually.
* Quick links are displayed if they are filled (wikipedia page, official page, goodreads author page etc...)
* Author data is shared among all users
!!! tip
    * It is possible to merge authors in case of unwanted duplication (J.R.R Tolkien and JRR Tolkien for example); this will erase the unwanted author from the database and add its books to the author you keep.
