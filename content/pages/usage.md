* Jelu will help you track your current, past and future readings.
* Jelu data is centered around the book, and the preferred way in Jelu to uniquely identify a book is its isbn, so anytime you can provide an isbn (if you don't automatically fetch metadata online), provide one.
* A book is unique, it means that for one isbn you should have only one entry in the database
* Jelu is a multi users app, so multiple users can have different events on the same book
* It means that when you see a book in Jelu you see a combination of the technical data of a book and your specific user data for this book.
* Also in search results or on a tag page you can see books that are stored in the database but not in your lists, those books are marked with a red plus sign and double clicking them will open a modal to ask what you want to do.
