Welcome to Jelu !

With Jelu you can : 

* manage your to-read list
* track the books you have read
* import single books (with automatic online metadata fetching)
* generate embed codes to display your read books outside of Jelu
* import you existing history from Goodreads
* tag books (to manage genres, lists, custom filters etc...)
* import author data (automatically fetch bio and other data from wikipedia)
* merge authors (because of duplicates, for example an automatic import could have added JRR Tolkien and J.R.R Tolkien)
* interact with the Jelu API
* create several users
* view some stats with your data
