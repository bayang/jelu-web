* You can import existing data from a Goodreads csv export or from a text file containing a list of ISBNs (one by line)
* Just go the the imports page in your dashboard
* Choose the import type (goodreads or ISBN list)
* Click the browse button to find the actual file you want to import
* Click the Import button

!!! tip
    * Make sure your Goodreads export file has ISBNs in it, the Jelu import will ignore lines without ISBNs

!!! tip
    * Once you clicked import you don't have to stay on the page. The task is now happening in the background
    * You will be notified of the events regarding your import in the messages section.

!!! warning
    * Do not reimport the same file or you could end with duplicate entries !
    * Jelu tries to prevent that from happening but some could happen
