* To create a custom list you need a name, a list of tags, an actionable flag and a public flag.
* A public list is visible by anyone, even people without jelu accounts.
* On an actionable list a checkbox is present and people can remove items from the list (useful in a shopping list or a wishlist for example, so that members of the family can remove what they bought for example).
* Books displayed in a list are the books that have all the tags you chose when you create the list.
* For example you can create a list with tags science-fiction and wishlist, all books with those tags will be displayed.

!!! danger
    * Beware ! On an actionable list, when a user removes an item from the list the tags are removed from the book, so with the example above both the science-fiction and the wishlist tags will be removed.
    * So maybe sometimes you will want to create a custom tag for one wishlist, eg christmas-bob-2025 and be done with it.
